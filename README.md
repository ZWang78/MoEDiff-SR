# MoEDiff-SR: Multi-Expert Diffusion Model for Brain MRI Super-Resolution

This repository implements **MoEDiff-SR**, a Transformer-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) diffusion framework for **region-adaptive super-resolution (SR)** of brain MRI. The model leverages anatomical specialization across multiple expert networks and a Swin Transformer-based gating mechanism conditioned on multi-scale 3T MRI inputs.
