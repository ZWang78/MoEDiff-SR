# MoEDiff-SR: Mixture of Experts-Guided Diffusion Model for Region-Adaptive MRI Super-Resolution

This repository implements **MoEDiff-SR**, a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-Guided diffusion framework for **region-adaptive super-resolution (SR)** of brain MRI. The model leverages anatomical specialization across multiple expert networks and a Swin Transformer-based gating mechanism conditioned on multi-scale 3T MRI inputs.
